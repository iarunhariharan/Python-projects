# 4-Python Function
Exercise 1: Create a function that takes in three arguments, two of which are
optional. The first argument should be a required positional argument, the second argument
should be a keyword argument with a default value of 10, and the third argument should be
a keyword argument with a default value of None. The function should print the sum of the
first two arguments if the third argument is None, and print the product of all three
arguments if the third argument is not None.

Exercise 2: Write a function that takes in a list of strings and returns a new list
with only the strings that have a length greater than or equal to 5.

Exercise 3: Write a Python program to evaluate a given mathematical expression
using the eval() function. expression = "3 * 5 + 2"

Exercise 4: (score : 2) Write a Python program to filter out the prime numbers from a given
list of integers using the filter() function.

Exercise 5: Write a Python program to convert a list of strings to uppercase using
